//Challenge 1
// Defining an array containing all 7 required cl  outputs.
let triangle = ["#","##","###","####","#####","######","#######"]
// Iterating through triangle array according to index and array.length.
for (let i = 0; i < triangle.length; i++) {
// console logging for each iteration until index is = array.length
 console.log(triangle[i])
}
